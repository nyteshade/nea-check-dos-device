WBHDFMounter

This is a simple script that uses CheckDosDevice to find the next available
unit on which to mount a HDF file automatically.

Requirements:
 - DiskImageGUI has been installed
 - MountHDF is available in path
 - CheckDosDevice is available either resident or in path

Install the script to S:
  Copy WBHDFMounter S:
  Protect WBHDFMounter RWEDS

Open you HDF's icon information using Right-Amiga I.

 1. Select the Icon tab
 2. Set the Default tool to S:WBHDFMounter
 3. Set "Start from:" to Shell
 4. Disable the checkmark for "Prompt for input:"

 Save and exit

 Now simply double click the HDF icon and it will mount (hopefully)
