I need you to create a comprehensive learning document/tutorial that explains [PROJECT NAME] development for [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Please follow this specific format and approach:

## Document Structure Requirements:

1. **Title Format**: "[Platform/Language] Programming: From [Familiar Technology] to [New Technology]"

2. **Opening**: Brief description of what the tutorial covers and what will be built

3. **Table of Contents**: Numbered sections with descriptive titles

4. **Content Sections** should include:
   - Introduction comparing familiar vs new environment (use comparison tables)
   - Core concept explanations with code examples
   - Practical patterns that emerged during development
   - Evolution of the code showing why decisions were made
   - Key takeaways in a highlighted box at the end

## Style Guidelines:

1. **Tone**: Professional but accessible, like explaining to a colleague
   
2. **Code Examples**: 
   - Show real code from the project
   - Include comments explaining non-obvious parts
   - Show both "wrong" and "right" approaches when relevant
   
3. **Visual Elements**:
   - Use colored boxes for: info (blue), warning (red), note (yellow)
   - Comparison tables for contrasting approaches
   - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
   
4. **Explanations**:
   - Start with "why" before "how"
   - Explain unfamiliar concepts by relating to familiar ones
   - Include common mistakes and how to avoid them

## Content Approach:

1. **Problem-Solution Format**: 
   - Show the problem encountered
   - Explain why obvious solutions don't work
   - Present the actual solution with reasoning

2. **Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Start with simple concepts
   - Build complexity gradually
   - Show evolution of the code through iterations

3. **Practical Focus**:
   - Include real usage examples
   - Show script/automation possibilities  
   - Demonstrate debugging techniques

## HTML/CSS Requirements:

Use the provided tutorial-style.css with these classes:
- .info, .warning, .note for alert boxes
- .comparison for side-by-side comparisons  
- .toc for table of contents
- Standard HTML tags (h1-h4, pre, code, table)

## Example Section Template:

```html
<h2 id="section-name">N. Section Title</h2>

<p>Brief introduction to what this section covers.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Explain what challenge we're addressing.</p>

<div class="warning">
  <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> What people usually try that doesn't work.
</div>

<h3>The Solution</h3>
<pre><code>// Actual code that solves the problem
// With helpful comments
</code></pre>

<div class="info">
  <strong>How it works:</strong> Explanation of why this solution works.
</div>
